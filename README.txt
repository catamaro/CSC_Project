Homomorphic Database
--------------------------
*IMPORTANT NOTE: To run the files you will not need to adjust any PC directories.

*To begin making queries you should first compile and run the .cpp inside the
Admin directory (inside you'll find the respective README file).

*After the command above you should compile and run the .cpp inside the
Server directory (inside you'll find the respective README file).

*Lastly you should compile and run the .cpp inside the Client1 and Client2
directory (inside you'll find the respective README file).

*Our databse is prepared to only have two clients, so you can send queries from each one of
these. Go inside the Client(1,2) directory compile and run the .cpp file.

*To delete all created files and directories the clear_files.sh bash code should be run 
as ./clear_files.sh.
