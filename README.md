# Homomorphic Database

- NOTE: To run the files you will not need to adjust any PC directories.

- To begin making queries you should first compile and run the .cpp inside the
Admin directory (inside you'll find the respective README file).

- After the command above you should compile and run the .cpp inside the
Server directory and leave it runnning (inside you'll find the respective README file).

- Lastly you should compile and run the .cpp inside the Client1, Client2 and Client3
directory to be able to execute queries(inside you'll find the respective README file).

- Our source code is prepared for three clients, so you can send queries from each one of
them to the server and access the database, however more clients can be created.

- To delete all created files and directories the clear_files.sh bash code can be used as  
shown below, however when the is server is closed the clear_files.sh is called 
automatically.
    - $ chmod +x clear_files.sh
    - $ ./clear_files.sh.
